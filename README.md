🚖 Uber Trip Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

A data-driven business intelligence project built in Power BI to analyze Uber trip data.
The dashboards uncover booking trends, revenue insights, customer behavior, and operational efficiency, enabling smarter decision-making for ride-hailing services.

📌 Project Overview

This project transforms raw Uber trip data into interactive dashboards that provide clear insights into:

📊 Bookings & Revenue Performance

⏰ Time-based Demand Trends

📍 Location Insights (Pickup & Drop-off Hotspots)

🚘 Vehicle Type Preferences & Performance

📑 Detailed Trip Records with Drill-through Analysis

The dashboards are designed with dynamic visuals, slicers, bookmarks, and KPIs to empower stakeholders with actionable intelligence.

🎯 Business Objectives

The analysis addresses the following key questions:

How many trips were booked, and what was the total revenue generated?

What are the average fare, trip distance, and trip duration?

Which locations are the most popular for pickups and drop-offs?

Which vehicle types contribute the most to revenue and efficiency?

When are the peak hours and days for ride demand?

What was the longest trip recorded, and what does it reveal about customer demand?
