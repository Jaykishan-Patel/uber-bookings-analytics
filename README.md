# 🚖 Uber Trip Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

This project explores Uber trip data to analyze bookings, revenue, trip efficiency, and demand patterns.
It includes interactive dashboards for overview, time-based trends, and detailed trip insights—helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview
The Uber Trip Analysis Dashboard is a data analytics project developed in Power BI to transform raw Uber trip records into meaningful business insights.
The goal is to help stakeholders understand ride demand, revenue performance, and operational efficiency through interactive visualizations.

The project delivers three dashboards:

* #### Overview Analysis – 
    Summarizes key KPIs such as Total Bookings, Revenue, Trip Distance, and Average Trip Time while providing insights by vehicle type, payment method, and popular locations.

* #### Time Analysis – 
    Examines booking patterns across different time intervals, days of the week, and peak demand hours using line charts, area charts, and heatmaps.

* #### Details – 
    Provides a drill-through enabled data grid for exploring granular trip-level details, supporting deeper analysis and decision-making.

By combining KPIs, dynamic filters, and drill-through capabilities, this project enables Uber to optimize driver allocation, pricing models, and customer satisfaction strategies.
## 🎯 Business Objectives
   The primary objective of this project is to leverage Power BI for analyzing Uber trip data and generate actionable insights that support strategic decision-making. Specifically, the dashboards aim to:

* #### 📊 Measure overall performance –
    Track total bookings, revenue, trip distance, and trip duration.

* #### ⏰ Understand demand trends – 
    Identify peak and off-peak booking times across days and hours.

* #### 📍 Analyze location patterns – 
    Detect the most frequent pickup and drop-off points to optimize driver availability.

* #### 🚘 Evaluate vehicle performance – 
    Compare bookings, revenue, and trip efficiency across different vehicle types.

* #### 💳 Study customer preferences – 
    Assess payment methods and trip types (day/night) to understand rider behavior.

* #### 🛠 Enable deep-dive analysis – 
    Provide trip-level drill-through details for operational and business insights.

By meeting these objectives, the analysis empowers Uber to enhance pricing strategies, demand forecasting, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
